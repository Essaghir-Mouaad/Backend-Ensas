OpenTDB QCM (Vanilla JS)

This small project fetches trivia questions from the OpenTDB API and renders a QCM (multiple-choice quiz) using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose options and click "Start QCM".
3. The app fetches questions and navigates to `qcm.html` where you can answer, navigate, and submit.

Notes

- Uses `sessionStorage` to pass fetched questions between pages.
- No build steps required; open files directly in the browser.
